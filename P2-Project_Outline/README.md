### Overview
When trying to learn new skills or hobbies, it can be easier to stick with learning if you have a community surrounding you. Our team decided to create a community-driven learning application where users can find others to learn skills from and teach skills to.

If a user has always wanted to learn a skill, they can search through the app for someone in the area who would be willing to teach them that skill. Users are also able to list what they're knowledgeable in, so that they can teach others those skills. Users will have a profile that lists what they know and what they're looking to learn, as well as the general area they live in. The user can also list their availability, so that it's easier to schedule a time to meet up with another user to learn/teach. Overall, our application seeks to create a stronger local community base surrounding learning and sharing knowledge.
